## Description

This is a full stack web application built using Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend. It allows users to mock a form payment in the Bounce website.

The backend provides a RESTful API with an endpoint for creating a booking.

The frontend is a single-page application that communicates with the backend API to display and manipulate data. It uses React Router for client-side routing and Axios for making API requests.

To get started, follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

To run the project, you'll need to set up both the backend and frontend.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `/backend` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `bundle install`.
3. Set up the database by running `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage

To run the project, go to `/backend` and run the command `bin/dev`. This starts both the backend and frontend applications.
